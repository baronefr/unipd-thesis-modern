    abstract = {An architecture for adiabatic quantum computing devices, which is programmed by local fields and features all-to-all connectivity. Quantum annealers are physical devices that aim at solving NP-complete optimization problems by exploiting quantum mechanics. The basic principle of quantum annealing is to encode the optimization problem in Ising interactions between quantum bits (qubits). A fundamental challenge in building a fully programmable quantum annealer is the competing requirements of full controllable all-to-all connectivity and the quasi-locality of the interactions between physical qubits. We present a scalable architecture with full connectivity, which can be implemented with local interactions only. The input of the optimization problem is encoded in local fields acting on an extended set of physical qubits. The output is—in the spirit of topological quantum memories—redundantly encoded in the physical qubits, resulting in an intrinsic fault tolerance. Our model can be understood as a lattice gauge theory, where long-range interactions are mediated by gauge constraints. The architecture can be realized on various platforms with local controllability, including superconducting qubits, NV-centers, quantum dots, and atomic systems.}

	abstract={State preparation plays a pivotal role in numerous quantum algorithms, including quantum phase estimation. This paper extends and benchmarks counterdiabatic driving protocols across three one-dimensional spin systems characterized by phase transitions: the axial next-nearest neighbor Ising, XXZ, and Haldane-Shastry models. We perform a shallow quantum optimal control over the counterdiabatic protocols by optimizing an energy cost function. Moreover, we provide a code package for computing symbolically various adiabatic gauge potentials. This protocol consistently surpasses standard annealing schedules, often achieving performance improvements of several orders of magnitude. The the axial next-nearest neighbor Ising model stands out as a notable example, where fidelities exceeding 0.5 are attainable in most cases. Furthermore, the optimized paths exhibit promising generalization capabilities to higher-dimensional systems, allowing for the extension of parameters from smaller models. Nevertheless, our investigations reveal limitations in the case of the XXZ and Haldane-Shastry models, particularly when transitioning away from the ferromagnetic phase. This suggests that finding optimal diabatic gauge potentials for specific systems remains an important research direction.}
